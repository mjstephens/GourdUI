# GourdUI
An MVC-style UI framework for Unity3D. Facilitates the creation of *UIScreens* (logical units of UI) with *UIViews* (visual implementations of UIScreens).

- Separates UI logic from working displays
- Allows for multiple view options per screen (only one view will be active at a time)
- Intelligently auto-filters to select best views for each screen based on device factors
- Create *UIState* data for every screen to allow views to hot-swap, inheriting the current state so the UI position is maintained
- Enforces modularity by ensuring screens and views only communicate through *UIContracts*, which define expected functionality
